## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.27+**
- **[`ko`](https://ko.build/)** (for building and deploying control plane images)
- **Docker** or **Podman** (for building the Linux task-runner container image)
- A Kubernetes cluster with [Agent Substrate](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate) installed

### Building Binaries

Build all local binaries (`bin/ax`, `bin/ax-controller`, `bin/ax-server`):

```bash
make build
```

Or install the `ax` CLI directly into `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`:

```bash
make install
```

Make sure that `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is on your `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

### Running Tests

Run all unit and integration tests (including the mock Substrate gRPC server and API server tests):

```bash
make test
```

Or run via `go test`:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### Building the Task Runner Image

Cross-compile the task runner for `linux/amd64` and package the container image:

```bash
make build-task-runner
```

To build and push to a remote container registry:

```bash
make push-task-runner TASK_RUNNER_REPO=gcr.io/<your-project>/ax-task-runner
```

### Deploying to Kubernetes

Deploy Redis, the Temporal worker, and the API server to your cluster in the `ax-system` namespace:

```bash
make deploy AX_IMAGE_REPO=gcr.io/<your-project>/ax-images
```

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Fork or Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rakyll/ax2.git
   cd ax2
   ```

2. **Ensure `main` is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull -r origin main
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

4. **Make changes and verify**:
   - Run tests: `make test`
   - Ensure clean modules: `go mod tidy` and verify with `git diff --exit-code go.mod go.sum`
   - Build binaries: `make build`

5. **Commit and open a PR**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"
   git push origin my-feature
   ```
   Open a pull request on GitHub describing the motivation and changes.
